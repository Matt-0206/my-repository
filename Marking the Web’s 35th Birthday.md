# Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: An Open Letter

The web was invented three and a half decades ago and even the creator itself of it didn't know the trajectory it would've taken. Now, at the Web's 35th birthday, there are 2 main issues regarding it: the first is the extent of power concentration which contradicts the decentralised spirits originally envisioned, now the platform is used     to keep user hooked on a singular platform to optimise profits exploiting studied business models. The second problem regards the "data market", the personal data market that has exploited people’s time and data with the creation of deep profiles that allow for targeted advertising and ultimately control over the information       people are fed. To transform the current system we need to tackle its existing problems and sustain the efforts of those visionary individuals who are actively working to build a new, improved system. A new paradigm is emerging, one that  places users intentions rather than business models, giving us a chance on regaining control over our data. It's driven by a new generation, a movement that seeks the objective to create a more human-centred web, aligned with the original ideas of the creator. A solution for this is the Solid Protocol, a movement that provides each user with their own 'personal online data store' also  known as a POD. This is a perfect example of the emergent movement the creator talked about. This emergent movement doesn't just happen, in fact it requires support for the people leading the reform, from reserachers to investors to advocates. The movement must be amplified and promote it's positive use cases. The Web Foundation, a foundation that was cofounded by the Web's creator and with the help of Rosemary Leith, continues to support and accelerate this emergent system and the people behind it. However there is an ugent need for other people to do the same and follow the mentioned example, to back up this emerging movement and to overturn the online world being dictated by profit to one that is dictated by the needs of humanity.
